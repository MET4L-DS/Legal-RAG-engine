If you are asked to provide a document in court, you must present it if you have it, even if there's a disagreement about whether it should be allowed as evidence. The court will decide if it can be used. The law also covers how documents are proven to be genuine, like official gazettes or newspapers."

Electronic records have the same legal standing as physical documents, *provided* they meet certain requirements for authenticity and reliability. The court will consider if the electronic record was created and maintained in a trustworthy manner. A certificate from the person in charge of the computer system is often required to verify the evidence. The court may also presume the authenticity of electronic records under certain conditions, like those found in Sections 81, 85, 86, 87, 90, and 93 of the BSA 2023."
