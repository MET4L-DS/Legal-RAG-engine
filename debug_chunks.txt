- **(b)** A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.

- **(c)** A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.

- **(a)** A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C.

- **(b)** A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.

- **(a)** A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.

- **(b)** A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.

- **(c)** A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.

- **(d)** A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft.

B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.

- **(a)** A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.

- **(b)** A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.

- **(c)** A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.

- **(d)** A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.

Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident:

Provided that the provocation is not,—

- **(a)** sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;

- **(b)** given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;

- **(a)** A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.

- **(b)** Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.

- **(c)** A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.

- **(d)** A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.

- **(e)** A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.

- **(f)** Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.

Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.

Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.

- **(a)** Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.

- **(b)** Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.

- **(c)** Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z.

- **(d)** A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.

- **(e)** A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.

- **(f)** A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.

- **(g)** Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.

- **(h)** A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.

- **(a)** A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.

- **(b)** A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent. A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.

- **(c)** A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.

- **(d)** A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.

- **(e)** Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.

- **(f)** A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.

- **(g)** A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.

- **(h)** A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.

- **(i)** A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.

- **(j)** If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.

- **(k)** Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.

- **(l)** A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.

- **(m)** A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.

- **(n)** A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.

- **(o)** A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.

- **(p)** A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of Z's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.

- **(a)** A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes, without Z's consent. Here A has committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore committed robbery.

- **(b)** A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery.

- **(c)** A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to fling it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z.

- **(d)** A obtains property from Z by saying—"Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us ten thousand rupees". This is extortion, and punishable as such; but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child.

- **(a)** A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.

- **(b)** A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.

CHAPTER XVII – OF OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY
Section 314 – Dishonest misappropriation of property
Explanation

**Explanation 2.—**

A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.

What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.

It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found.

Section 335 – Making a false document
Sub-section (1) / Illustration

- **(a)** A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.

- **(b)** A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.

- **(c)** A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.

- **(d)** A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.

- **(e)** A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.

- **(f)** Z's will contains these words—"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C." A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.

- **(g)** A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words "Pay to Z or his order" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words "Pay to Z or his order", and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.

- **(h)** A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.

- **(i)** Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.

- **(j)** A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.

- **(k)** A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.

B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.

- **(e)** A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.

- **(b)** A is charged under sub-section (2) of section 118 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by sub-section (2) of section 122 of the said Sanhita, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it.

- **(c)** A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or criminal intimidation, or that he used a false property mark, without reference to the definitions, of those crimes contained in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023; but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance be referred to in the charge.

- **(d)** A is charged under section 219 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, with intentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.

Section 238 – Effect of errors
Illustration

- **(a)** A is charged under section 180 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, with “having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit,” the word “fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material.

- **(b)** A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.

- **(c)** A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.

- **(d)** A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 2023. In fact, the murdered person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 2023. A was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.

- **(e)** A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 2023. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.

(a) A is tried for the murder of B. The facts that A murdered C, that B knew that A had murdered C, and that B had tried to extort money from A by threatening to make his knowledge public, are relevant.

(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money. B denies the making of the bond. The fact that, at the time when the bond was alleged to be made, B required money for a particular purpose, is relevant.

(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison. The fact that, before the death of B, A procured poison similar to that which was administered to B, is relevant.

(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A. The facts that, not long before, the date of the alleged will, A made inquiry into matters to which the provisions of the alleged will relate; that he consulted advocates in reference to making the will, and that he caused drafts of other wills to be prepared, of which he did not approve, are relevant.

(e) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the alleged crime, A provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an appearance favourable to himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented the presence or procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are relevant.

(f) The question is, whether A robbed B. The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in A's presence—"the police are coming to look for the person who robbed B", and that immediately afterwards A ran away, are relevant.

(g) The question is, whether A owes B ten thousand rupees. The facts that A asked C to lend him money, and that D said to C in A's presence and hearing—"I advise you not to trust A, for he owes B ten thousand rupees", and that A went away without making any answer, are relevant facts.

(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The fact that A absconded, after receiving a letter, warning A that inquiry was being made for the criminal, and the contents of the letter, are relevant.

(i) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, after the commission of the alleged crime, A absconded, or was in possession of property or the proceeds of property acquired by the crime, or attempted to conceal things which were or might have been used in committing it, are relevant.

(j) The question is, whether A was raped. The fact that, shortly after the alleged rape, A made a complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that, without making a complaint, A said that A had been raped is not relevant as conduct under this section, though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) of section 26, or as corroborative evidence under section 160.

(k) The question is, whether A was robbed. The fact that, soon after the alleged robbery, A made a complaint relating to the offence, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that A said he had been robbed, without making any complaint, is not relevant, as conduct under this section, though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) of section 26, or as corroborative evidence under section 160.

(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A. The state of A's property and of his family at the date of the alleged will may be relevant facts.

(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms that the matter alleged to be libellous is true. The position and relations of the parties at the time when the libel was published may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue. The particulars of a dispute between A and B about a matter unconnected with the alleged libel are irrelevant, though the fact that there was a dispute may be relevant if it affected the relations between A and B.

(c) A is accused of a crime. The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A absconded from his house, is relevant under section 6, as conduct subsequent to and affected by facts in issue. The fact that, at the time when he left home, A had sudden and urgent business at the place to which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that he left home suddenly. The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent.

(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, on leaving A's service, says to A—"I am leaving you because B has made me a better offer". This statement is a relevant fact as explanatory of C's conduct, which is relevant as a fact in issue.

(e) A, accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who is seen to give it to A's wife. B says as he delivers it—"A says you are to hide this". B's statement is relevant as explanatory of a fact which is part of the transaction.

(f) A is tried for a riot and is proved to have marched at the head of a mob. The cries of the mob are relevant as explanatory of the nature of the transaction.

Illustration

(a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It is proved that he was in possession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.

(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is relevant. The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit currency knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.

(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious. The fact that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant.

(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee was fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that A knew that the payee was a fictitious person.

(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B. The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question. The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B.

(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good faith.

(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner, by the order of C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in question, so that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent for A.

(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found. The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found. The fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A knew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith.

(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent, the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be proved.

(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously sent by A to B may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.

(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife. Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts.

(l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements made by A during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.

(m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when an assurance on his life was effected. Statements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the time in question are relevant facts.

(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a car for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereby A was injured. The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular car is relevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the cars which he let to hire is irrelevant.

(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead. The fact that A on other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B. The fact that A was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant.

(p) A is tried for a crime. The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that particular crime is relevant. The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.

(a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is insured. The facts that A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in each of which a fire occurred, and after each of which fires A received payment from a different insurance company, are relevant, as tending to show that the fires were not accidental.

(b) A is employed to receive money from the debtors of B. It is A's duty to make entries in a book showing the amounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he received less than he really did receive. The question is, whether this false entry was accidental or intentional. The facts that other entries made by A in the same book are false, and that the false entry is in each case in favour of A, are relevant.

(c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit currency. The question is, whether the delivery of the currency was accidental. The facts that, soon before or soon after the delivery to B, A delivered counterfeit currency to C, D and E are relevant, as showing that the delivery to B was not accidental.

A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat, coercion or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him:

Provided that if the confession is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat, coercion or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed, it is relevant:

Provided further that if such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him.

Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases, namely:—

- **(a)** when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person's death comes into question. Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question;

- **(b)** when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business, or in the discharge of professional duty; or of an acknowledgement written or signed by him of the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a document used in commerce written or signed by him; or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him;

- **(c)** when the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the person making it, or when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages;

- **(d)** when the statement gives the opinion of any such person, as to the existence of any public right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the existence of which, if it existed, he would have been likely to be aware, and when such statement was made before any controversy as to such right, custom or matter had arisen;

- **(e)** when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption between persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage or adoption the person making the statement had special means of knowledge, and when the statement was made before the question in dispute was raised;

- **(f)** when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption between persons deceased, and is made in any will or deed relating to the affairs of the family to which any such deceased person belonged, or in any family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family portrait or other thing on which such statements are usually made, and when such statement was made before the question in dispute was raised;

- **(g)** when the statement is contained in any deed, will or other document which relates to any such transaction as is specified in clause (a) of section 11;

- **(h)** when the statement was made by a number of persons, and expressed feelings or impressions on their part relevant to the matter in question.

(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or A dies of injuries received in a transaction in the course of which she was raped. The question is whether she was raped by B; or the question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit would lie against B by A's widow. Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death, referring respectively to the murder, the rape and the actionable wrong under consideration, are relevant facts.

    (b) The question is as to the date of A's birth. An entry in the diary of a deceased surgeon regularly kept in the course of business, stating that, on a given day he attended A's mother and delivered her of a son, is a relevant fact.

    (c) The question is, whether A was in Nagpur on a given day. A statement in the diary of a deceased solicitor, regularly kept in the course of business, that on a given day the solicitor attended A at a place mentioned, in Nagpur, for the purpose of conferring with him upon specified business, is a relevant fact.

    (d) The question is, whether a ship sailed from Mumbai harbour on a given day. A letter written by a deceased member of a merchant's firm by which she was chartered to their correspondents in Chennai, to whom the cargo was consigned, stating that the ship sailed on a given day from Mumbai port, is a relevant fact.

    (e) The question is, whether rent was paid to A for certain land. A letter from A's deceased agent to A, saying that he had received the rent on A's account and held it at A's orders is a relevant fact.

    (f) The question is, whether A and B were legally married. The statement of a deceased clergyman that he married them under such circumstances that the celebration would be a crime is relevant.

    (g) The question is, whether A, a person who cannot be found, wrote a letter on a certain day. The fact that a letter written by him is dated on that day is relevant.

    (h) The question is, what was the cause of the wreck of a ship. A protest made by the captain, whose attendance cannot be procured, is a relevant fact.

- **(i)** The question is, whether a given road is a public way. A statement by A, a deceased headman of the village, that the road was public, is a relevant fact.

- **(j)** The question is, what was the price of grain on a certain day in a particular market. A statement of the price, made by a deceased business person in the ordinary course of his business, is a relevant fact.

- **(k)** The question is, whether A, who is dead, was the father of B. A statement by A that B was his son, is a relevant fact.

- **(l)** The question is, what was the date of the birth of A. A letter from A's deceased father to a friend, announcing the birth of A on a given day, is a relevant fact.

- **(m)** The question is, whether, and when, A and B were married. An entry in a memorandum book by C, the deceased father of B, of his daughter's marriage with A on a given date, is a relevant fact.

- **(n)** A sues B for a libel expressed in a painted caricature exposed in a shop window. The question is as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous character. The remarks of a crowd of spectators on these points may be proved.

(d) A enters into a written contract with B to work certain mines, the property of B, upon certain terms. A was induced to do so by a misrepresentation of B's as to their value. This fact may be proved.

(e) A institutes a suit against B for the specific performance of a contract, and also prays that the contract may be reformed as to one of its provisions, as that provision was inserted in it by mistake. A may prove that such a mistake was made as would by law entitle him to have the contract reformed.

(f) A orders goods of B by a letter in which nothing is said as to the time of payment, and accepts the goods on delivery. B sues A for the price. A may show that the goods were supplied on credit for a term still unexpired.

(h) A hires lodgings of B, and gives B a card on which is written—“Rooms, ten thousand rupees a month”. A may prove a verbal agreement that these terms were to include partial board. A hires lodging of B for a year, and a regularly stamped agreement, drawn up by an advocate, is made between them. It is silent on the subject of board. A may not prove that board was included in the term verbally.

(i) A applies to B for a debt due to A by sending a receipt for the money. B keeps the receipt and does not send the money. In a suit for the amount, A may prove this.

Section 119 – Court may presume existence of certain facts
Sub-section (2)

**(2)** The Court shall also have regard to such facts as the following, in considering whether such maxims do or do not apply to the particular case before it:—

- **(i)** as to Illustration (a)—a shop-keeper has in his bill a marked rupee soon after it was stolen, and cannot account for its possession specifically, but is continually receiving rupees in the course of his business;

- **(ii)** as to Illustration (b)—A, a person of the highest character, is tried for causing a man's death by an act of negligence in arranging certain machinery. B, a person of equally good character, who also took part in the arrangement, describes precisely what was done, and admits and explains the common carelessness of A and himself;

- **(iii)** as to Illustration (b)—a crime is committed by several persons. A, B and C, three of the criminals, are captured on the spot and kept apart from each other. Each gives an account of the crime implicating D, and the accounts corroborate each other in such a manner as to render previous concert highly improbable;

- **(iv)** as to Illustration (c)—A, the drawer of a bill of exchange, was a man of business. B, the acceptor, was a young and ignorant person, completely under A's influence;

- **(v)** as to Illustration (d)—it is proved that a river ran in a certain course five years ago, but it is known that there have been floods since that time which might change its course;

- **(vi)** as to Illustration (e)—a judicial act, the regularity of which is in question, was performed under exceptional circumstances;

- **(vii)** as to Illustration (f)—the question is, whether a letter was received. It is shown to have been posted, but the usual course of the post was interrupted by disturbances;

- **(viii)** as to Illustration (g)—a man refuses to produce a document which would bear on a contract of small importance on which he is sued, but which might also injure the feelings and reputation of his family;

- **(ix)** as to Illustration (h)—a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled by law to answer, but the answer to it might cause loss to him in matters unconnected with the matter in relation to which it is asked;

- **(x)** as to Illustration (i)—a bond is in possession of the obligor, but the circumstances of the case are such that he may have stolen it.

(a) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relevant fact by a person alleged to be dead, which statement is relevant under section 26. The fact that the person is dead must be proved by the person proposing to prove the statement, before evidence is given of the statement.

(b) It is proposed to prove, by a copy, the contents of a document said to be lost. The fact that the original is lost must be proved by the person proposing to produce the copy, before the copy is produced.

(c) A is accused of receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen. It is proposed to prove that he denied the possession of the property. The relevancy of the denial depends on the identity of the property. The Court may, in its discretion, either require the property to be identified before the denial of the possession is proved, or permit the denial of the possession to be proved before the property is identified.

(d) It is proposed to prove a fact A which is said to have been the cause or effect of a fact in issue. There are several intermediate facts B, C and D which must be shown to exist before the fact A can be regarded as the cause or effect of the fact in issue. The Court may either permit A to be proved before B, C or D is proved, or may require proof of B, C and D before permitting proof of A.

(b) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed from a situation for dishonesty. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that he was dismissed for dishonesty. The evidence is not admissible.

(c) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Goa. A is asked whether he himself was not on that day at Varanasi. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that A was on that day at Varanasi. The evidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on a fact which affects his credit, but as contradicting the alleged fact that B was seen on the day in question in Goa. In each of these cases, the witness might, if his denial was false, be charged with giving false evidence.

(d) A is asked whether his family has not had a blood feud with the family of B against whom he gives evidence. He denies it. He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his impartiality.

**Eligibility to Register a Zero FIR** :

A Zero FIR can be reported by the victim, a family member, a relative, or any other individual with knowledge of the facts relating to the incident on behalf of the victim.

**Obligation to Register a Zero FIR** :

FIRs are typically filed at the police station. However, FIRs may also be filed via email, telephone, or online in certain instances. Unlike a regular FIR, a Zero FIR ensures that the police register the FIR irrespective of jurisdiction, facilitating a more expedited investigation. The process for registering a Zero FIR mirrors that of a standard FIR. The police officer records the statement and all necessary information, providing a duplicate copy to the informant at no cost.

Prior to registration of Zero First Information Report (ZFIR), it is essential to determine whether the offence is cognizable or non-cognizable.

1. A Zero FIR can be registered only in cases of cognizable offences.

2. In case of non-cognizable offences, the complainant should to be advised to approach the Magistrate having Jurisdiction or Police Station where the offence has taken place.

3. The police shall enter the substance of the information in a ledger referred to as the ‘General Diary’.

4. If the information is received through electronic communication, it shall be taken on record by him on being signed within three days by the person giving it.

5. Section 173(2) of BNSS mandates that if report received through electronic communication, it shall be taken on record by him on being signed within three days by the person giving it, failure to sign the stipulated period, what steps have to be taken by the police officer was not specified under section 173 of BNSS.

6. If the informant did not turn up within 3 days, the information discloses cognizable offence, after ascertaining truthfulness of the incident alleged in report will be transferred to the jurisdictional Police Station for action, as a matter of fact, crime is not only against victim but it is against whole society as well. The accused cannot go scot-free for not turning up to sign for obvious reasons subsequently happened.

**Conclusion:**

A Zero FIR provides a straight forward method for registering a

report/complaint at a police station, even if the crime occurred outside the jurisdiction of the police station which enables the police to secure incriminating evidence from the scene without any delay. Advancements in technology have enabled the filing of FIRs online, and the status of FIRs can be monitored virtually.

Therefore, an FIR should be registered promptly after the commission of an

offence to preserve facts and evidence.

- If consent of the women or competent person is not obtained, then any medical examination done on the victim women is unlawful

### SEARCH AND SEIZURE PROTOCOL (TECHNICAL – FORENSIC PERSPECTIVE)

#### **VIDEOGRAPHY RECORDING OF CRIME SCENE**

- BNSS sec 176(3) - mandatory related to an offence which is made punishable for 7yrs of more.

- Videography of the process on mobile phone or other electronic device.

#### **RECORDING OF SEARCH AND SEIZURE:**

- BNSS sec 105 – mandatory recording of search and seizure through audio–video electronic means.

#### **ADMISSABILITY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS:**

- Sections 57 & 63 of BSA

- Audio-Video recordings as part of:

    1.  Procedural compliance

    2.  Investigative compliance

    3.  Each seizure of relevant digital evidence.

- The above three instance needs certification by handler and by a Forensic

  Expert under PART A & Part B (63(4)(c) of BSA). Digital Forensic

  Expert – It is pertinent here to highlight sec 329 of BNSS which is

  captioned as “Reports of certain Government Scientific Experts”,

  certified by notification by the state or central government.

**Procedural compliance:**

1. Only the digital repository created through audio video recording ofprocedure of search, seizure and statement etc. produced to the trial court in proper Chain of Custody (either in e-Case diary or ICJS enabled app e-sakshya).

**Investigative compliance:**

1. The evidence already available which is to be searched and seized.

2. The digital evidences created through audio video recording of procedure of search, seizure, statement, etc & produced in proper Chain of Custody (either in e-Case diary or ICJS enabled app e- sakshya) to the trial court.

**Overview of Audio-Video recording:**

- Ensure the safety of all individuals at the crime scene.

- Protect the integrity of evidence.

- Use personnel protective equipment to prevent contamination, Disposable device and gloves should be used for collection of evidence.

- Evaluate the scene and formulate a search plan.

- Identify potential evidence

- Secure the scene of crime and prepare for audio-video recordings

- Follow the standard methods of crime scene search (search and seizure authorisation, warrant issue-date and time, minimum officers, panchas and technical team).

- Pre-search conditions of a crime scene need to be photographed and video-graphed in a 360^0 view (special attention need to be made by ensuring close-up pictures of front and back side of all equipment in connection to configuration details).

- The starting and ending shot of crime scene recorded need to be mentioned specifically (by clearly announcing the commencement and also end of search and seizure operation).

- Precautions to be taken at every stage to avoid critical failures (Technical issues, procedural faults etc.,)

**Technical Considerations:**

- Types of devices – Mobile phones or Audio-video recorder.

- Ecosystem – secure the crime scene, preliminary survey, sketching of crime scene and contamination control.

- Device management:

    1.  Mobile phone and Audio-video recorder – Devices authorized and issued by the department should only be used for recording crime scene.

    2.  Only authorized, skilled personnel to be deployed to handle audio- video recording.

    3.  A new/empty external SD/memory card should be used with capacity not less than 128GB (surveillance/industrial grade) along with spare memory cards handy.

    4.  Ensure proper working condition of the device, date and time should be set to the IST and ensure that date and time, location (with latitude and longitude) to be displayed on image/video recorded by adjusting the settings.

    5.  Availability, retainability of device for continuous use by ensuring the charging or extra batteries/power banks to be ensured.

    6.  Use light/flash, noise cancellation and maintain silence for better quality image/video based on the crime scene conditions.

    7.  Camera settings should be set to normal mode (no filters should be applied).

    8.  Stability of camera, use a tripod or stabilizer to prevent shaky footage (avoid zooming/panning), use of safe route while capturing without disturbing the scene is advised.

    9.  Continuity of video recording of the scene to be maintained (avoid pausing).

    10. Images captured should be with 90^0 evidence rulers i.e., vertical and horizontal planes (Grid view) – can be used for close-up photographs/videos of injured.

    11. Capture close-ups of the seized items showing their condition, identifying marks and labels by clearly narrating the discovery of seized items.

    12. Video graph the victim’s injury, witnesses and the scene, preparation and signing of seizure list by panchas.

    13. End the video recording with the announcement of summary, search and seizure operation in the recording.

    14. Enable certification by handler and by a Forensic Expert under Part A& PART B (63(4)(c) of BSA). **Digital Forensic Expert –sec 329 of BNSS which is captioned as “Reports of certain Government Scientific Experts”, certified by notification by the state or central government.**

    15. 63(4)(c) certification does not require the owner of device but the person who actually manages the device regularly at the relevant time.

**Post recording:**

- Review the recording for accuracy and completeness.

- Storing the evidence as permanent record in order to ensure authenticity and prevent manipulation.

- Production and admissibility of evidence to be ensured through chain of custody.

- All the video files recorded should be stored to memory card but not internal memory of the mobile phone.

- Video shall not be viewed with any device that would enable editing of the digital images, such as a memory card reader or a computer.

- Default generated file names of the video files /recordings should not be altered or renamed. Retain the same file name through the proceedings

- The officer at the scene should not delete any digital images which are photographically faulty. Digital images that are relevant for investigative or trial purposes can be printed at a later time.

- Label the recording with date, time, location, case details and brief description of the recording by placing the memory card in an evidence envelope (anti-static bag) along with identifying case information tag and sealed.

- The sealed memory card to be delivered to the authorised, designated evidence specialist of the investigation team along with chain of custody form.

- Download the unaltered images into a computer file which has limited access. The writing software approved by the department should not permit re-writing or alteration of recorded images.

- The evidence specialist, or the designated officer, will copy, without opening, the digital images/ Video onto a Hard Disk or Pen drive or storage devices which will become the “master negative.”(However, the pendrive or Hard disk should be Write-once-read-many times-WORM enabled). This master negative disk is the permanent record and to be stored in secured location.

- A working record(Duplicate copy or mirror image) on a separate pendrive or hard disk is to be made from the master negative disk by copying the files without opening them.

- The audio-video recording will be scanned for any virus.

- Hashing should be doneat this stage, to validate and verify the integrity of the video files and their secure transfer from mobile phone/audio-video recorder of primary, master negative and mirror image using dedicated hard ware and software to establish chain of custody.

- However,When seizing digital evidence hashing should be done through write blocking devices to make it alter proof or any accidental data tampering due to mishandling.

- Hash values are to be documented and Transfers should be depicted in chain of custody forms with responder & evidence specialist (trained _Head Mohrir_ ) signatures.

- Hash value of the individual image/ video footage to be mentioned in the panchnama, case diary, seizure memo.

- Hence the evidence specialist or data manager or trained Head Mohrir (crime record Munshi as is known in certain PS ) will transfer the mirror image in pen drive or storage device to the designated desktop of Magistrate along with memos and chain of custody forms.

- Hash verification i.e.,giving matching hash value of original record as proof of evidence shall be admissible as secondary evidence. Importance is given to the integrity of a specific file and not to the entire storage medium.

- The audio-video recording will then be deleted from the police officer’s smartphone or audio-video recorder, making space for more recordings to be made in the future.

- The issue of transport and production will be resolved once the app based uploading and retrieving of audio-video records will start on applications via e-Sakshya.

    **HASH function:** The HASH function or summary function is used to verify the integrity of a data set. In other words, it is about obtaining its “fingerprint”. A mathematical algorithm is applied on data to generate an alpha-numeric string of fixed characters.Hashing is a fingerprinting of any digital data present in non-volatile medium and it may be done with respect to any file, folder or complete media which contains data.It will remains same of same data but any slightest change in data will change the hashing value entirely which can be easily noticed on comparison. This procedure is applied here when making copies of the original data, so that, once the HASH value of the origin and destination has been calculated, they must be identical. This process is known as verification.

- Different hashing algorithms are as follows:

    1.  MD5 (Message Digest 5 )

    2.  SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)

    3.  SHA-2 family (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)

    4.  SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)

- Following tools are available for hashing:

    1.  Hash Check.

    2.  Hash Cal

    3.  Hash Tab

    4.  Hash My Files

    5.  MD5 Hash Generator

    6.  SHA-256 Online

    7.  Cyber Chef

### 1. Evidence Preservation: Crime Scene

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this procedure is to secure digital evidence located at a non-laboratory location to preserve its integrity for further forensic processing.

**Scope:**

This SOP describes procedures to follow when providing digital forensics assistance at non-laboratory locations.

**Equipment:**

A digital forensics field response kit may contain some of the following:

1. Digital camera

2. Sterilized removable media

3. Forensic computer or Laptop with the necessary standard forensic tools installed

4. Hardware write-blocking devices

5. Forensically sound boot disks

6. Mobile device acquisition tools

7. Tool kit (screw drivers, etc.)

8. Evidence packaging materials for digital media storage devices such as Hard disks, USB devices, DVDs, or CDs; Anti-static zip-lock evidence bags

9. Forensic tools dongle licenses

10. Faraday Bags to inhibit signals to mobile phones and other devices that may receive data from mobile/Wi-Fi network

11. Network cables (crossed and braided), Seal, Gloves, Magnifying glasses and Mask.

**Secure the scene:**

In electronic evidence collection, the aim is to avoid the loss, alteration or destruction of any possible evidence.

- Locate the most obvious elements, computers and mobile phones, especially those that are connected to the Internet and those that need special assurance measures to prevent data loss.

- Check the existence of wireless networks that allow access and modification of data from outside.

1. Ensure the safety of all individuals at the scene.

2. Protect the integrity of evidence.

3. Evaluate the scene and formulate a search plan.

4. Identify potential evidence.

5. All potential evidence should be secured, documented, and/or photographed.

6. Any item to be removed from the scene should be properly packaged and secured.

For each device, the following data must be documented:

- Type: Computer, hard drive, flash drive, DVD, etc.

- Brand and model

- Storage capacity, indicating if it is MB, GB or TB

- Serial number

- State: Damaged, on, off, etc.

- Location: Stay and specific place

- Security: Access password, PIN

Any annotation related to the use of passwords, settings, email accounts, etc., as well as the SIM cardholders with their ICCID, original PIN and PUK number and any other relevant information that may be searched and documented. They will be used in the subsequent analysis of the devices.

### 2. Computers/Laptops:

Document the location and condition of all computers and/or devices. Document all connections to the computer.

#### a. Networked:

1. Unplugging a suspect computer from a network may cause data loss and could potentially damage other computers on the network.

2. Computer networks can be technically complex and may prevent collection of evidence in a timely manner.

_Note: If the system administrator is a suspect in the case, assistance should be sought from personnel knowledgeable in the network’s operation._

#### b. Non-networked:

1. Powering down a suspect’s computer may cause data loss and potentially damage the operating system.

2. While securing the computer, there may be chances that evidence may be destroyed or manipulated, the computer should be shut down.

- Disable screensavers and screen locking in order to prevent the equipment from being hibernated or suspended.

- Check if the device has any kind of encryption system running (Bitlocker, FileVault, VeraCrypt, PGP Disk, etc.).

- Even if the device is not fully encrypted, it is important to have the suspect's passwords. The suspect might have encrypted a file.

- Generating a forensic copy of each evidence and capturing volatile data apply the specific procedure.

- If using a forensic tool at a crime scene, this must only be carried out by authorized and trained personnel and ensure that the reason for examining the evidence at the scene is documented and controlled.

**Shutdown procedures:**

a. Pull the plug from the back of the computer, or when necessary normal shutdown procedures should be utilized. When forcibly shutting down a computer, the plug should be pulled from the back of the unit, not from the outlet.

b. For laptops you must either push the power button until the system shuts off or remove the battery. Current laptops, especially "notebook" types, have batteries and hard drives integrated into the computer so it is not always easy or possible to remove them. We can find laptops with NVMe/SSD type disks integrated into the mainboard, in which it will not be possible to obtain a forensic copy by using traditional methods. Many of these computers require the use of special tools, and to avoid damaging them.

c. Do not unplug an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) backup unit to cut power to a computer, because the battery in the UPS could power the computer long enough to complete any destructive processes.

### 3. Mobile Phone Devices:

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the steps to collect mobile devices.

**Scope:**

This procedure shall be followed when collecting mobile devices on-scene.

**Equipment:**

1. Active devices are susceptible to data destruction due to network communication.

2. Mobile devices may lose data or initiate additional security measures once discharged or shut down.

3. Some components and devices are susceptible to immediate physical destruction and should be physically secured.

4. A device may be protected with a password, PIN, token or other authentication mechanism, the suspect may be queried for this information during the initial stage.

5. Document the location and condition of all handheld digital devices including on-screen data.

6. If possible, physically remove the battery from the device, otherwise power off the device in the appropriate manner.

7. Search the scene for removable media, passwords, or other pertinent information.

8. Use RF shielding, anti-static bags (e.g. Faraday bag, etc.)

**Evaluation (Triage):**

In order to access the contents of a memory device to assess its relevance to the case, it is essential to use blockers either by software - provided and validated by laboratories - or by blockers by firmware. In case of optical discs, you can proceed with your exam using a CD / DVD reader that does not allow writing.

**Procedure:**

1. Physically secure the mobile device. Separating the device from its user, network isolation are necessary to ensure evidence is not modified or destroyed.

2. Perform other forensic examinations (biological testing, fingerprints, DNA, etc.).

3. Block the mobile device from receiving RF signals by placing the phone in Airplane mode or using an RF shielding device. The “airplane mode” feature in newer versions of mobile operating systems may not disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other wireless protocols or may only disconnect them temporarily, manually confirm network isolation.

4. Turn off the mobile device if unable to block the RF signals.

5. Submit the mobile device for examination as quickly as possible.

6. Remove the battery from the mobile device, if possible, if storing it for an extended time. This will prevent the battery from corroding the inside of the mobile device.

**iOS Preservation Process:**

- iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple exclusively for its mobile hardware, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.

- All iPhones utilize hardware and software encryption so if the device has a password/passcode/Face ID then the user of the handset must supply the information required to gain access to the handset otherwise the forensic lab may not be able to access the handset data.

- Place the device in “Airplane Mode” (by swiping up from the bottom and selecting airplane mode) and verify that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are off. If the device cannot be placed in “Airplane Mode”, put it in a Faraday bag to prevent network interaction from potentially altering data on the device.

- Both the mobile device and the charging source should be placed inside the Faraday bag.

- If the charging source is not placed in the Faraday bag, the cable can act as an antenna and the device may be able to connect to the network. If the device is off, leave it off. Collect identifying data about the device, such as model number, carrier and unique identifiers that are visible.

**Android Preservation Process:**

Android is a Linux-based mobile operating system developed by Google and has the largest install base of any mobile operating system. Android is available in many different versions and, unlike iOS, is offered on devices manufactured by numerous companies.

**a) The device is power on.**

- Photograph the screen in the state it is in. Check the battery and if the date and time the device shows correspond to the actual date and time upon seizure.

- IMEI check: dial \* # 06 # and photograph. - Make a logical image of the device with the forensic device, including reading the SIM.

- Make a physical image of the device if it is supported.

- Turn off the device. Remove battery, SIM / USIM card and memory expansion card and photograph the assembly with the identification tag.

- Do not turn on the equipment again.

**b) The device is power off.**

- Check if support is available for acquiring a forensic image. - The battery is removed and the items to be checked are located: SIM card and external memory.

- If the device cannot be placed in “Airplane Mode”, follow the same procedure as for Apple devices. If the device is off, leave it off. Collect identifying data about the device, such as model number, carrier and unique identifiers that are visible.

**SIM / USIM:**

SIM card is read by checking if it is protected by a PIN. If available, it is entered only once, because if it is tried 3 times without success, it is blocked. To unlock it, you will need the PUK code, which is located on the original cardholder or that can be requested from the mobile service provider. In any case, the ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) will be obtained, which is its serial number.

**Removable Media/memory cards:**

If a handset allows the use of a removable memory card, then this card is used for expansion of the phone storage capacity. Removable storage is commonplace amongst Android handsets as this allows the user to store multimedia.

### 4. Servers:

- Server-type computer equipment provides service to other client computers. We can find them mainly in business environments performing functions of a file server, mail, web services, database, user management, etc.

- The preferred process to seize information from servers is to make a selective logical copy of the suspect's folder. But you also have to consider getting the event logs, the active directory settings, mailboxes and the backups.

### 5. Cloud Data:

- Both Apple and Android phones require the user to have either a Google Account (Android) or an iCloud account (Apple). These cloud services enable the user to backup data to the cloud, as well as share their photos, videos, audio files etc. They also make it possible to backup handset user data in case the device is lost or it has to be transferred to a new handset. The process of seizing cloud data, to be employed along with user credentials, Collect and document this information, subject to applicable legal requirements.

### 6. IoT devices:

In addition to the traditional IT devices described above, in recent years several devices have been defined as "IoT" or the Internet of Things. These devices can be very different from each other in terms of functionality, such as smart watches, smart TVs, video surveillance devices, and so on.

### 7. Smart-watches:

- A smartwatch contains several functionalities, allowing you to do many things you normally do with your phone. To seize a smartwatch, it would be preferable to follow the same indications already provided in the mobile phone section.

- The seizure of other IOT devices smart Tv, gaming console smart speakers etc., disconnect them collect user accounts and application passwords, document everything, take pictures of the device, label and pack.

### 8. Drones:

- Drones - also referred as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned aerial system (UAS), small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) or remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS).

- Digital forensics on drones and associated equipment is to identify flight paths, user data, and associated pictures and videos contained within the devices that will assist in understanding the drone and its usage. A drone usually consists of the following two types of components.

- Drones/controllers are usually presented with two distinct media storage types that require separate handling techniques.

**- If power on:**

Take pictures of the controller’s display then turn off the drone and its components. Isolate the drone from GPS satellites and other devices to ensure that GPS/Wi-Fi/Network signals contained. Identify the make and model of the drone. Search the drone for any external storage media, i.e. SD Cards. Photograph and label the status of the drone and its components. Securely pack all of the components.

**- Memory Cards:**

These can be examined as a computer hard disk. If time and resources allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and that clone inserted into the handset.

**- Internal Memory:**

This requires drone/mobile compatible manufacturer/forensic tools. Some devices are supported by forensic tools for physical extraction. The forensic tools will boot the device in a particular way and conduct physical extraction without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device.

### 9. Cryptocurrency/Virtual assets devices:

- First responders need to be aware of the different ways to access, store and transfer virtual assets. Crypto currency wallets come in different shapes and forms: files in a computer/phone, hardware devices, QR codes or even a sequence of words written in a piece of paper or memorized by the suspect.

- Desktop wallets: Bitcoin Core, Armory, Electrum, Wasabi, Bither, etc.

- Mobile wallets: Mycelium, Edge, BRD, Trust, etc.

- Online wallets: BitGo, BTC.com, Coin.Space, Blockchain.com, etc.

- Hardware wallets: BitBox, Coldcard, KeepKey, Ledger, Trezor, etc.

- Paper wallets: addresses generated by bitaddress.org, segwitaddress.org, etc. need to be searched.

- Regardless of the wallet type, the crucial information that needs to be collected is the unencrypted Private Key, In most cases, however, the Private Key is protected, or it might not be stored locally.

- Passwords, PINs, Credentials (username and password for online wallets), QR codes (can store the full private key), Seeds- the sequence of words (typically 24 or more) used to recreate the private key. For the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, private keys are 256-bit numbers that can be represented in many different ways. Wallet Import Format (WIF) is the most common.

**HASH function:**

- The HASH function or summary function is used to verify the integrity of a data set. In other words, it is about obtaining its “fingerprint”.

- In the case of electronic evidence, this procedure is applied when making copies of the original devices, so that, once the HASH value of the origin and destination has been calculated, they must be identical. This process is known as verification.

- It will remains same of same data but any slightest change in data will change the hashing value entirely which can be easily noticed on comparison.

**Different hashing algorithms are as follows:**

- MD5 (Message Digest 5)

- SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)

- SHA-2 family (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA- 512)

- SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)

**Following tools are available for hashing:**

- Hash Check

- Hash Cal

- Hash Tab

- Hash My Files

- MD5 Hash Generator

- SHA-256 Online

### Imaging and Preview

**Purpose:**

### IV. VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE OF ARREST BY PRIVATE PERSON.

Under BNSS 2023, private persons have a specific set of guidelines that they must follow when arresting and producing an individual before a police officer. It is critical for private persons to adhere to these statutory provisions. However, even if there is non-compliance with these statutory provisions, this does not automatically subject the private person to penal action.

The actions of a private person must be examined in conjunction with the general exceptions outlined in sections 14, 17 to 19 of the BNS. Penal liability arises only if a private person commits or omits violations voluntarily, dishonestly, fraudulently, and intentionally, thereby, committing acts such as omission to give information to police bound by law, omits to assist police officer bound by law, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, criminal force, assault, abduction, intimidation, or voluntarily causing hurt etc..,

#### Detaining more than 6 hours by Private Person

In particular, detaining an individual for more than six hours, does not automatically result in penal action against a private person. It is the responsibility of the police officer to determine whether the delay in producing the arrested individual was due to any culpability. If culpability is found, the police officer can then take appropriate action in accordance with the provisions of BNS 2023.

#### Computation of time of 6 Hours and 24 hours

The BNSS 2023 framework ensures that the rights of individuals are protected through strict time limits on detention without oversight. It delineates clear responsibilities between private individuals and police officers regarding arrest and custody, ensuring that procedural safeguards are maintained while accommodating practicalities of private arrests. The BNSS 2023 also provides a detailed framework for the procedure of arrest and post-arrest protocols under Chapter V. This includes the seizure of property, informing the arrestee and their family of the grounds of arrest, conducting medical examinations, and other procedures necessary for investigating a cognizable offence. Section 58 of BNSS, which mandates that, no person shall be detained in custody for more than 24 hours without being produced before a magistrate, excluding the time required for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s court. By excluding the time, a person is held by a private individual from the 24-hour detention limit, the statute balances the need for immediate action in arrests made by private persons with the procedural rigor expected of law enforcement.

**Section 58**: This section imposes a duty on police officers to ensure that an arrested person is not detained for more than 24 hours without being presented before a magistrate. The 24-hour period begins when the police officer takes custody of the arrested person.

**Exemption for Private Persons (Section 40)**: The provisions regarding the arrest procedure and the 24-hour detention limit do not apply to private persons who make an arrest. Instead, private individuals are allowed up to 6 hours to hand over the arrested person to a police officer. The rationale behind this provision is to facilitate the production of the arrested individual before a police officer, who will then take custody and assume responsibility for the subsequent legal procedures.

**Calculation of Detention Time**: For police officers, the 24-hour detention period stipulated in Section-58 starts when they take custody of the person from a private individual. The time during which, the individual is detained by the private person is not counted within the 24-hour period.

**Duty of Police Officers**: Police officers must be diligent in ensuring that, once, they take custody of an arrestee from a private person, they adhere strictly to the 24 - hour rule to avoid unlawful detention.

**Conclusion**

Hence, statutory obligation under section 58 is only to the police officer as such, 24 hours stipulated under section 58 shall begin from the moment when police officer takes custody of arrested person from private person. Therefore, time of detention time by private person can be excluded from 24 hours as provided under section 58 of BNSS.

But, total period of detention in Judicial custody is 90 days in case of an offence punishable to death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment more than 10 years, in other offences the detention period is 60 days for granting mandatory bail. The Investigating officer may take police custody at a time or in different spells, not exceeding 15 days in total.

As per section 187 of BNSS, if an accused is arrested and there is no time to produce before the concerned jurisdictional Magistrate within twenty-four hours, he shall be produced before the nearest Judicial Magistrate and the Magistrate shall accept the remand and if necessary, shall also give police custody not exceeding fifteen days in total as per procedure in Section187 of BNSS. But, in case of special Acts like POCSO and SC/ST (POA)Act, only the designated special courts have the power to give police custody on production of the accused and on filing of requisition by the Investigation officer.

Sub-section (2)

The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023 (BSA 2023) addresses technological advancements that the previous law did not cover. BSA provides for the admissibility of electronic or digital records as evidence with the same legal effect, validity, and enforceability as any other documents. To be admissible in court, electronic evidence must meet the tests of relevancy, admissibility, and proof as outlined in the BSA.

There are two types of evidence to prove a fact: oral and documentary.

- Oral evidence must be direct according to Section 55 of BSA, subject to certain exceptions.

- Documentary evidence must be by producing the original documents, with some exemptions as provided in BSA.

  The method of proving documents is specifically mentioned in BSA.

Electronic evidence is recognized as documentary evidence under the definition in Section 2(e) of BSA, but there is no specific method of proving electronic evidence.

Section 62 provides a special provision relating to electronic evidence, stating that it may be proved in accordance with the provisions of Section 63 of BSA. If the conditions of Section 63 are satisfied, electronic evidence shall be admissible in any proceeding without further proof or production of the original.

Section 63 of BSA deals with the admissibility of electronic records:

The conditions mentioned in sub-section (1) for the computer output are as follows:

(a) The computer output was produced by a computer or communication device that was regularly used to create, store, or process information for regular activities by the person in control of the device.

(b) During this time, information similar to what is in the electronic record was regularly entered into the computer or communication device as part of these regular activities.

(c) The computer or communication device was working properly throughout relevant time, or if it wasn't, any issues didn't affect the electronic record or its accuracy.

(d) The information in the electronic record comes from information that was regularly entered into the computer or communication device during these activities.

3. If over a period, the function of creating, storing, or processing information for regular activities was done using one or more computers or communication devices, whether:

   (a) in standalone mode,

   (b) on a computer system,

   (c) on a computer network,

   (d) using a computer resource for creating, processing, or storing information, or

   (e) through an intermediary,

   all these computers or devices will be considered as one single computer or communication device for this section. References to a computer or communication device in this section will be understood in this way.

4. In any legal proceeding where a statement from an electronic record is to be used as evidence under this section, a certificate must be submitted with the electronic record each time it is presented. The certificate must:

   (a) Identify the electronic record containing the statement and explain how it was produced.

   (b) Provide details about any device involved in producing the electronic record to show it was made by a computer or communication device mentioned in section (3).

   (c) Address any conditions mentioned in section (2).

   The certificate should be signed by the person in charge of the computer or device, or the person managing the relevant activities, and an expert. This certificate will serve as evidence of the matters stated within it. It is enough for the person to state these matters to the best of their knowledge and belief, as specified in the Schedule.

5. For this section:

   (a) Information is considered to be supplied to a computer or communication device if it is provided in any suitable form, either directly or through appropriate equipment, with or without human help.

   (b) Computer output is considered to be produced by a computer or communication device whether it was created directly by it or through appropriate equipment or other electronic means mentioned in section (3)(a) to (e), with or without human help.

**PROOF OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE**: The BSA specifies the mode of proving electronic records as follows:

Proof of Electronic Signature: If an electronic record contains a secure electronic signature, it can only be proved by the subscriber of that electronic signature (Section 66).

Verification of Digital Signature: To ascertain whether a digital signature belongs to a person, the court may examine the controller, certifying authority, or the person who applied the public key (Section 73).

**Presumptions on electronic records**: On proving of electronic evidence as above, the court has the power to presume the genuineness of electronic records.

- **Section 81** – The court shall presume that electronic or digital records claiming to be the Official Gazette or those required by law to be kept are genuine if they are kept in the correct form and produced from proper custody.

- **Section 85** - The court shall presume that every electronic record purporting to be an agreement containing the electronic or digital signatures of the parties was concluded by affixing those signatures.

- **Section 86** - The court shall presume, unless proven otherwise, that a secure electronic record has not been altered since the specific point in time to which its secure status relates. It also presumes, unless proven otherwise, that a secure electronic signature was affixed by the subscriber with the intention of signing or approving the electronic record.

- **Section 87** - The court shall presume, unless proven otherwise, that the information listed in an Electronic Signature Certificate is correct, except for subscriber information that has not been verified, if the certificate was accepted by the subscriber.

- **Section 90** - The court may presume that an electronic message forwarded by the originator through an electronic mail server to the addressee corresponds with the message as fed into his computer for transmission, but does not make any presumption about the person who sent the message.

- **Section 93** - The court may presume that any electronic record purporting or proven to be five years old and produced from proper custody was affixed with the electronic signature of the person it purports to be, or by any person authorized by him, subject to the Explanation to Section 84.

  The above provisions ensure that electronic evidence is handled consistently and fairly in legal proceedings under the BSA.

## **SOP - ROLE OF PHOTOGRAPHER U/S 497 BNSS, 2023**

The Apex court in _Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai_ vs _State Of Gujarat_ while dealing with disposal of property under Section 451 and 457 or Cr.P.C, certain guidelines were formulated, in which taking photographs while delivering the property for interim custody was mandated. This is the root cause for incorporating sub-section (2) to (5) of section 497 of BNSS, 2023 – detailing the procedure to be adopted by a Magistrate before passing an order for disposal of property. The procedure is as follows -

- Once the property is seized by Police during investigation, it may be produced before the Criminal Court, or the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance or to commit the case for trial.

- The Magistrate before whom the property is produced shall within in a period of 14 days of its production before him, prepare a statement of such property with its description in such form and manner as provided by the State Government. (State Government has to frame Rules in this regard)

- Later, the Magistrate shall cause to be taken the photographs of such property.

- Apart from photographs, the Magistrate if he thinks necessary, may take video-graph on mobile phone or any electronic media of such property.

- The above-mentioned statement and photograph or videography shall be used as evidence in inquiry or trail.

- Such statement, photograph or videograph has utmost significance as they alone can be used in evidence without the need for its physical production again during trial.

- However, no procedure for taking such photographs and videography is mentioned in this section.

- Hence, the Rules that are to be prepared under sub-section (2) of section 497, shall also include the procedure, for taking such photographs and videographs.

- This procedure shall include details like

  o who shall take the photograph or videograph

  o in which electronic devices the same shall be taken

  o how those photographs or videographs shall be submitted and made part of the court record

  o chain of custody of the photographs and videograph

  o who shall bear the expenditure for such photography or videography

  o how those photographs or videographs shall be certified to be genuine.

- Only after following the above-mentioned procedure i.e preparing statement, taking photographs or videograph, the Magistrate shall order for disposal of property under sub-section (5) of section 497, BNSS, 2023.

> **Note:** Where police seize property during an investigation, they should report the same to a Magistrate. If the seized property is not produced before the Magistrate but is in the custody of that police officer, the Magistrate has to dispose of the property in terms of Section 503 of BNSS, 2023. However, this section does not provide for taking photographs or videographs as contemplated under Section 497, BNSS, 2023. Hence, to give evidentiary value to such seizure, it shall be mandated that the procedure mentioned under subsections (2) to (5) of Section 497 be followed. Therefore, the State Govt. may have to frame rules in this regard.

## **SOP CHANGE IN JURISDICTION JJB'S**

**Q) Section 27 of Cr.PC was deleted so what is the impact on jurisdiction of juvenile cases?**

**Section 27 of Cr.PC Says: - Jurisdiction in the case of juveniles**.— _Any offence not punishable with death or imprisonment for life, committed by any person who at the date when he appears or is brought before the Court is under the age of sixteen years, may be tried by the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate, or by any Court specially empowered under the Children Act, 1960 (60 of 1960), or any other law for the time being in force providing for the treatment, training and rehabilitation of youthful offenders._

- Here we should consider age of a juvenile.

- In S.27 CrPC age is prescribed 16 years but now this was deleted in BNSS which means we should consider the age of a juvenile or child who is not completed age of 18 years as defined in S.2(13) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

**A) Removal of Section 27 of CrPC in BNSS will not have any effect in the present scenario as JJ Act being special enactment prevail over BNSS.**

- 'CHILD" is defined under Sec 2 (12) of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.

- A Person who has not completed 18 years of age is a child and the same definition is assigned for child in sec 2(3) of BNS, 2023.

- Sec 27 of CrPC says:

  a) Any offence not Punishable with death/life imprisonment.

  b) Any person who at the date when he appears or is brought before JJB is under 16 years of age.

  c) May be tried by chief Judicial Magistrate (or) Court specially empowered under Children Act 1960 or any other law.

- Under BNSS, this sec 27 CrPC has been removed entirely but this will not impact the current scenario since the provision regarding the same Section 27 CrPC has to be incorporated in JJ Act 2015.

- Sec 20 (20) of JJ act, children Court “ is defined in JJ Act:

  a) Court established under the commission for protection of Child Rights Act 2005.

  b) Court established under special Court under POCSO act 2012.

  c) Whenever, any Courts, not existing or designated, the Court of Session will have Jurisdiction to try offences under this Act.

- Section 4 JJ Act 2015:

  a) Notwithstanding anything contained in CrPC.

  b) State Government shall constitute JJB in every District.

  c) A board shall consist of metropolitan Magistrate or CJM along with 02 members.

  d) Bench has powers conferred by CrPC on Metropolitan Magistrate or JFCM.

- Section 86 (4) JJ Act:

  a) Notwithstanding anything contained in CrPC, or protection of child Rights Act 2005, or POCSO Act or offences under this Act shall be triable by Childrens Court.

**SYNOPSIS:**

- Definition of Child under JJ Act and BNS are one and the same.

- JJ Act defines the constitution of children’s Court JJ Act also discusses the power of MM/JFCM who is chairman of the board.

- S.86 (4) clearly states that, offences under JJ Act i.e., Offences committed by children **“ punishable under any penal act”** shall be triable by children Court/Board established under JJ Act.

- Section 2 (20) JJ Act defines Children Court.

- S.2(35) defines "juvenile" means a child below the age of eighteen years;

- Removal of Section 27 of CrPC in BNSS will not have any effect in the present scenario as JJ Act being special enactment prevails over BNSS.

- So all cases relating to Juvenile shall be dealt with as per the procedure of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

## **TREATMENT OF CASES WHERE CC NUMBERS ARE RELEASED AFTER GO-LIVE DATE FROM JUDICIARY BUT WERE REGISTERED EARLIER**

As per clause (a) sub-section (2) of Section 531 of BNSS, 2023, _any appeal, application, trial, inquiry_ **_or investigation pending_** _, then, such appeal, application, trial, inquiry or_ **_investigation shall be disposed of_** _, continued, held or made, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973... as if this Sanhita has not come into force._

This means that all the proceedings of case at whatever stage it may be i.e. from registration of FIR to final disposal of the case, if initiated under Cr.P.C. 1973 before BNSS, 2023 came into force. Then such proceedings at whatever stage it may be continued and disposed off as per the provisions of Cr.P.C 1973 only.

Therefore, it is opined that if a case is registered under IPC, 1860, however the CC number is given after BNSS, 2023 comes into force (1st July 2024) the case shall be tried as per the provisions of Cr.P.C 1973.
