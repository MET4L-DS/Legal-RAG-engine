## Section 261 — Compliance with section 230

---

## Section 262 — When accused shall be discharged

**(1)** The accused may prefer an application for discharge within a period of sixty days from the date of supply of copies of documents under section 230.

**(2)** If, upon considering the police report and the documents sent with it under section 193 and making such examination, if any, of the accused, either physically or through audio-video electronic means, as the Magistrate thinks necessary and after giving the prosecution and the accused an opportunity of being heard, the Magistrate considers the charge against the accused to be groundless, he shall discharge the accused, and record his reasons for so doing.

---

## Section 263 — Framing of charge

**(1)** If, upon such consideration, examination, if any, and hearing, the Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable under this Chapter, which such Magistrate is competent to try and which, in his opinion, could be adequately punished by him, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused within a period of sixty days from the date of first hearing on charge.

**(2)** The charge shall then be read and explained to the accused, and he shall be asked whether he pleads guilty of the offence charged or claims to be tried.

---

## Section 264 — Conviction on plea of guilty

If the accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate shall record the plea and may, in his discretion, convict him thereon.

---

## Section 265 — Evidence for prosecution

**(1)** If the accused refuses to plead or does not plead, or claims to be tried or the Magistrate does not convict the accused under section 264, the Magistrate shall fix a date for the examination of witnesses:

Provided that the Magistrate shall supply in advance to the accused, the statement of witnesses recorded during investigation by the police.

**(2)** The Magistrate may, on the application of the prosecution, issue a summons to any of its witnesses directing him to attend or to produce any document or other thing.

**(3)** On the date so fixed, the Magistrate shall proceed to take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution:

Provided that the Magistrate may permit the cross-examination of any witness to be deferred until any other witness or witnesses have been examined or recall any witness for further cross-examination:

Provided further that the examination of a witness under this sub-section may be done by audio-video electronic means at the designated place to be notified by the State Government.

---

## Section 266 — Evidence for defence

**(1)** The accused shall then be called upon to enter upon his defence and produce his evidence; and if the accused puts in any written statement, the Magistrate shall file it with the record.

**(2)** If the accused, after he has entered upon his defence, applies to the Magistrate to issue any process for compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination or cross-examination, or the production of any document or other thing, the Magistrate shall issue such process unless he considers that such application should be refused on the ground that it is made for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice and such ground shall be recorded by him in writing:

Provided that when the accused has cross-examined or had the opportunity of cross-examining any witness before entering on his defence, the attendance of such witness shall not be compelled under this section, unless the Magistrate is satisfied that it is necessary for the ends of justice:

Provided further that the examination of a witness under this sub-section may be done by audio-video electronic means at the designated place to be notified by the State Government.

**(3)** The Magistrate may, before summoning any witness on an application under sub-section

**(2)** , require that the reasonable expenses incurred by the witness in attending for the purposes of the trial be deposited in Court.

B.—Cases instituted otherwise than on police report

**(2)** The Magistrate may, on the application of the prosecution, issue a summons to any of its witnesses directing him to attend or to produce any document or other thing.

---

## Section 268 — When accused shall be discharged

**(1)** If, upon taking all the evidence referred to in section 267, the Magistrate considers, for reasons to be recorded, that no case against the accused has been made out which, if unrebukted, would warrant his conviction, the Magistrate shall discharge him.

**(2)** Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a Magistrate from discharging the accused at any previous stage of the case if, for reasons to be recorded by such Magistrate, he considers the charge to be groundless.

---

## Section 269 — Procedure where accused is not discharged

**(1)** If, when such evidence has been taken, or at any previous stage of the case, the Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable under this Chapter, which such Magistrate is competent to try and which, in his opinion, could be adequately punished by him, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused.

**(2)** The charge shall then be read and explained to the accused, and he shall be asked whether he pleads guilty or has any defence to make.

**(3)** If the accused pleads guilty, the Magistrate shall record the plea, and may, in his discretion, convict him thereon.

**(3)** , he shall be required to state, at the commencement of the next hearing of the case, or, if the Magistrate for reasons to be recorded in writing so thinks fit, forthwith, whether he wishes to cross-examine any, and, if so, which, of the witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence has been taken.

**(5)** If he says he does so wish, the witnesses named by him shall be recalled and, after cross-examination and re-examination (if any), they shall be discharged.

**(6)** The evidence of any remaining witnesses for the prosecution shall next be taken, and after cross-examination and re-examination (if any), they shall also be discharged.

**(7)** Where, despite giving opportunity to the prosecution and after taking all reasonable measures under this Sanhita, if the attendance of the prosecution witnesses under sub-sections

**(5)** and

**(6)** cannot be secured for cross-examination, it shall be deemed that such witness has not been examined for not being available, and the Magistrate may close the prosecution evidence for reasons to be recorded in writing and proceed with the case on the basis of the materials on record.

**(3)** Where, in any case under this Chapter, a previous conviction is charged under the provisions of sub-section

## Section 273 — Compensation for accusation without reasonable cause

**(1)** If, in any case instituted upon complaint or upon information given to a police officer or to a Magistrate, one or more persons is or are accused before a Magistrate of any offence triable by a Magistrate, and the Magistrate by whom the case is heard discharges or acquits all or any of the accused, and is of opinion that there was no reasonable ground for making the accusation against them or any of them, the Magistrate may, by his order of discharge or acquittal, if the person upon whose complaint or information the accusation was made is present, call upon him forthwith to show cause why he should not pay compensation to such accused or to each or any of such accused when there are more than one; or, if such person is not present, direct the issue of a summons to him to appear and show cause as aforesaid.

**(2)** The Magistrate shall record and consider any cause which such complainant or informant may show, and if he is satisfied that there was no reasonable ground for making the accusation, may, for reasons to be recorded, make an order that compensation to such amount, not exceeding the amount of fine he is empowered to impose, as he may determine, be paid by such complainant or informant to the accused or to each or any of them.

**(3)** The Magistrate may, by the order directing payment of the compensation under sub-section

**(6)** A complainant or informant who has been ordered under sub-section

**(2)** by a Magistrate of the second class to pay compensation exceeding two thousand rupees, may appeal from the order, as if such complainant or informant had been convicted on a trial held by such Magistrate.

**(7)** When an order for payment of compensation to an accused person is made in a case which is subject to appeal under sub-section

**(6)** , the compensation shall not be paid to him before the period allowed for the presentation of the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal is presented, before the appeal has been decided; and where such order is made in a case which is not so subject to appeal the compensation shall not be paid before the expiration of one month from the date of the order.

**(8)** The provisions of this section apply to summons-cases as well as to warrant-cases.
