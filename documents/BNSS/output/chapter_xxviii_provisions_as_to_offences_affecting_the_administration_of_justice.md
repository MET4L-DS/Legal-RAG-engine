- **(b)** make a complaint thereof in writing;

- **(c)** send it to a Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction;

**(2)** In every such case the Court shall follow, as nearly as may be practicable, the procedure prescribed for summary trials.

**(3)** Nothing in this section shall affect the power of the Court to make a complaint under section 379 for the offence, where it does not choose to proceed under this section.
