## **SOP ON REGISTRATION OF ZERO FIR**

**Eligibility to Register a Zero FIR** :
A Zero FIR can be reported by the victim, a family member, a relative, or any other individual with knowledge of the facts relating to the incident on behalf of the victim.

**Obligation to Register a Zero FIR** :
FIRs are typically filed at the police station. However, FIRs may also be filed via email, telephone, or online in certain instances. Unlike a regular FIR, a Zero FIR ensures that the police register the FIR irrespective of jurisdiction, facilitating a more expedited investigation. The process for registering a Zero FIR mirrors that of a standard FIR. The police officer records the statement and all necessary information, providing a duplicate copy to the informant at no cost.

Prior to registration of Zero First Information Report (ZFIR), it is essential to determine whether the offence is cognizable or non-cognizable.

1. A Zero FIR can be registered only in cases of cognizable offences.
2. In case of non-cognizable offences, the complainant should to be advised to approach the Magistrate having Jurisdiction or Police Station where the offence has taken place.
3. The police shall enter the substance of the information in a ledger referred to as the ‘General Diary’.
4. If the information is received through electronic communication, it shall be taken on record by him on being signed within three days by the person giving it.
5. Section 173(2) of BNSS mandates that if report received through electronic communication, it shall be taken on record by him on being signed within three days by the person giving it, failure to sign the stipulated period, what steps have to be taken by the police officer was not specified under section 173 of BNSS.
6. If the informant did not turn up within 3 days, the information discloses cognizable offence, after ascertaining truthfulness of the incident alleged in report will be transferred to the jurisdictional Police Station for action, as a matter of fact, crime is not only against victim but it is against whole society as well. The accused cannot go scot-free for not turning up to sign for obvious reasons subsequently happened.

**Conclusion:**

A Zero FIR provides a straight forward method for registering a
report/complaint at a police station, even if the crime occurred outside the jurisdiction of the police station which enables the police to secure incriminating evidence from the scene without any delay. Advancements in technology have enabled the filing of FIRs online, and the status of FIRs can be monitored virtually.

Therefore, an FIR should be registered promptly after the commission of an
offence to preserve facts and evidence.

### SEARCH AND SEIZURE PROTOCOL (TECHNICAL – FORENSIC PERSPECTIVE)

#### **VIDEOGRAPHY RECORDING OF CRIME SCENE**

- BNSS sec 176(3) - mandatory related to an offence which is made punishable for 7yrs of more.
- Videography of the process on mobile phone or other electronic device.

#### **RECORDING OF SEARCH AND SEIZURE:**

- BNSS sec 105 – mandatory recording of search and seizure through audio–video electronic means.

#### **ADMISSABILITY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS:**

- Sections 57 & 63 of BSA
- Audio-Video recordings as part of:
    1.  Procedural compliance
    2.  Investigative compliance
    3.  Each seizure of relevant digital evidence.
- The above three instance needs certification by handler and by a Forensic
  Expert under PART A & Part B (63(4)(c) of BSA). Digital Forensic
  Expert – It is pertinent here to highlight sec 329 of BNSS which is
  captioned as “Reports of certain Government Scientific Experts”,
  certified by notification by the state or central government.

**Procedural compliance:**

1. Only the digital repository created through audio video recording ofprocedure of search, seizure and statement etc. produced to the trial court in proper Chain of Custody (either in e-Case diary or ICJS enabled app e-sakshya).

**Investigative compliance:**

1. The evidence already available which is to be searched and seized.
2. The digital evidences created through audio video recording of procedure of search, seizure, statement, etc & produced in proper Chain of Custody (either in e-Case diary or ICJS enabled app e- sakshya) to the trial court.

**Overview of Audio-Video recording:**

- Ensure the safety of all individuals at the crime scene.
- Protect the integrity of evidence.
- Use personnel protective equipment to prevent contamination, Disposable device and gloves should be used for collection of evidence.
- Evaluate the scene and formulate a search plan.
- Identify potential evidence
- Secure the scene of crime and prepare for audio-video recordings
- Follow the standard methods of crime scene search (search and seizure authorisation, warrant issue-date and time, minimum officers, panchas and technical team).
- Pre-search conditions of a crime scene need to be photographed and video-graphed in a 360^0 view (special attention need to be made by ensuring close-up pictures of front and back side of all equipment in connection to configuration details).
- The starting and ending shot of crime scene recorded need to be mentioned specifically (by clearly announcing the commencement and also end of search and seizure operation).
- Precautions to be taken at every stage to avoid critical failures (Technical issues, procedural faults etc.,)

**Technical Considerations:**

- Types of devices – Mobile phones or Audio-video recorder.
- Ecosystem – secure the crime scene, preliminary survey, sketching of crime scene and contamination control.
- Device management:
    1.  Mobile phone and Audio-video recorder – Devices authorized and issued by the department should only be used for recording crime scene.
    2.  Only authorized, skilled personnel to be deployed to handle audio- video recording.
    3.  A new/empty external SD/memory card should be used with capacity not less than 128GB (surveillance/industrial grade) along with spare memory cards handy.
    4.  Ensure proper working condition of the device, date and time should be set to the IST and ensure that date and time, location (with latitude and longitude) to be displayed on image/video recorded by adjusting the settings.
    5.  Availability, retainability of device for continuous use by ensuring the charging or extra batteries/power banks to be ensured.
    6.  Use light/flash, noise cancellation and maintain silence for better quality image/video based on the crime scene conditions.
    7.  Camera settings should be set to normal mode (no filters should be applied).
    8.  Stability of camera, use a tripod or stabilizer to prevent shaky footage (avoid zooming/panning), use of safe route while capturing without disturbing the scene is advised.
    9.  Continuity of video recording of the scene to be maintained (avoid pausing).
    10. Images captured should be with 90^0 evidence rulers i.e., vertical and horizontal planes (Grid view) – can be used for close-up photographs/videos of injured.
    11. Capture close-ups of the seized items showing their condition, identifying marks and labels by clearly narrating the discovery of seized items.
    12. Video graph the victim’s injury, witnesses and the scene, preparation and signing of seizure list by panchas.
    13. End the video recording with the announcement of summary, search and seizure operation in the recording.
    14. Enable certification by handler and by a Forensic Expert under Part A& PART B (63(4)(c) of BSA). **Digital Forensic Expert –sec 329 of BNSS which is captioned as “Reports of certain Government Scientific Experts”, certified by notification by the state or central government.**
    15. 63(4)(c) certification does not require the owner of device but the person who actually manages the device regularly at the relevant time.

**Post recording:**

- Review the recording for accuracy and completeness.
- Storing the evidence as permanent record in order to ensure authenticity and prevent manipulation.
- Production and admissibility of evidence to be ensured through chain of custody.
- All the video files recorded should be stored to memory card but not internal memory of the mobile phone.
- Video shall not be viewed with any device that would enable editing of the digital images, such as a memory card reader or a computer.
- Default generated file names of the video files /recordings should not be altered or renamed. Retain the same file name through the proceedings
- The officer at the scene should not delete any digital images which are photographically faulty. Digital images that are relevant for investigative or trial purposes can be printed at a later time.
- Label the recording with date, time, location, case details and brief description of the recording by placing the memory card in an evidence envelope (anti-static bag) along with identifying case information tag and sealed.
- The sealed memory card to be delivered to the authorised, designated evidence specialist of the investigation team along with chain of custody form.
- Download the unaltered images into a computer file which has limited access. The writing software approved by the department should not permit re-writing or alteration of recorded images.
- The evidence specialist, or the designated officer, will copy, without opening, the digital images/ Video onto a Hard Disk or Pen drive or storage devices which will become the “master negative.”(However, the pendrive or Hard disk should be Write-once-read-many times-WORM enabled). This master negative disk is the permanent record and to be stored in secured location.
- A working record(Duplicate copy or mirror image) on a separate pendrive or hard disk is to be made from the master negative disk by copying the files without opening them.
- The audio-video recording will be scanned for any virus.
- Hashing should be doneat this stage, to validate and verify the integrity of the video files and their secure transfer from mobile phone/audio-video recorder of primary, master negative and mirror image using dedicated hard ware and software to establish chain of custody.
- However,When seizing digital evidence hashing should be done through write blocking devices to make it alter proof or any accidental data tampering due to mishandling.
- Hash values are to be documented and Transfers should be depicted in chain of custody forms with responder & evidence specialist (trained _Head Mohrir_ ) signatures.
- Hash value of the individual image/ video footage to be mentioned in the panchnama, case diary, seizure memo.
- Hence the evidence specialist or data manager or trained Head Mohrir (crime record Munshi as is known in certain PS ) will transfer the mirror image in pen drive or storage device to the designated desktop of Magistrate along with memos and chain of custody forms.
- Hash verification i.e.,giving matching hash value of original record as proof of evidence shall be admissible as secondary evidence. Importance is given to the integrity of a specific file and not to the entire storage medium.
- The audio-video recording will then be deleted from the police officer’s smartphone or audio-video recorder, making space for more recordings to be made in the future.
- The issue of transport and production will be resolved once the app based uploading and retrieving of audio-video records will start on applications via e-Sakshya.

    **HASH function:** The HASH function or summary function is used to verify the integrity of a data set. In other words, it is about obtaining its “fingerprint”. A mathematical algorithm is applied on data to generate an alpha-numeric string of fixed characters.Hashing is a fingerprinting of any digital data present in non-volatile medium and it may be done with respect to any file, folder or complete media which contains data.It will remains same of same data but any slightest change in data will change the hashing value entirely which can be easily noticed on comparison. This procedure is applied here when making copies of the original data, so that, once the HASH value of the origin and destination has been calculated, they must be identical. This process is known as verification.

- Different hashing algorithms are as follows:
    1.  MD5 (Message Digest 5 )
    2.  SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
    3.  SHA-2 family (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)
    4.  SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)

- Following tools are available for hashing:
    1.  Hash Check.
    2.  Hash Cal
    3.  Hash Tab
    4.  Hash My Files
    5.  MD5 Hash Generator
    6.  SHA-256 Online
    7.  Cyber Chef

- Location: Stay and specific place
- Security: Access password, PIN

Any annotation related to the use of passwords, settings, email accounts, etc., as well as the SIM cardholders with their ICCID, original PIN and PUK number and any other relevant information that may be searched and documented. They will be used in the subsequent analysis of the devices.

### 2. Computers/Laptops:

Document the location and condition of all computers and/or devices. Document all connections to the computer.

#### a. Networked:

1. Unplugging a suspect computer from a network may cause data loss and could potentially damage other computers on the network.
2. Computer networks can be technically complex and may prevent collection of evidence in a timely manner.

_Note: If the system administrator is a suspect in the case, assistance should be sought from personnel knowledgeable in the network’s operation._

#### b. Non-networked:

1. Powering down a suspect’s computer may cause data loss and potentially damage the operating system.
2. While securing the computer, there may be chances that evidence may be destroyed or manipulated, the computer should be shut down.

- Disable screensavers and screen locking in order to prevent the equipment from being hibernated or suspended.
- Check if the device has any kind of encryption system running (Bitlocker, FileVault, VeraCrypt, PGP Disk, etc.).
- Even if the device is not fully encrypted, it is important to have the suspect's passwords. The suspect might have encrypted a file.
- Generating a forensic copy of each evidence and capturing volatile data apply the specific procedure.
- If using a forensic tool at a crime scene, this must only be carried out by authorized and trained personnel and ensure that the reason for examining the evidence at the scene is documented and controlled.

**Shutdown procedures:**
a. Pull the plug from the back of the computer, or when necessary normal shutdown procedures should be utilized. When forcibly shutting down a computer, the plug should be pulled from the back of the unit, not from the outlet.

b. For laptops you must either push the power button until the system shuts off or remove the battery. Current laptops, especially "notebook" types, have batteries and hard drives integrated into the computer so it is not always easy or possible to remove them. We can find laptops with NVMe/SSD type disks integrated into the mainboard, in which it will not be possible to obtain a forensic copy by using traditional methods. Many of these computers require the use of special tools, and to avoid damaging them.
c. Do not unplug an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) backup unit to cut power to a computer, because the battery in the UPS could power the computer long enough to complete any destructive processes.

### 3. Mobile Phone Devices:

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this procedure is to describe the steps to collect mobile devices.

**Scope:**
This procedure shall be followed when collecting mobile devices on-scene.

**Equipment:**

1. Active devices are susceptible to data destruction due to network communication.
2. Mobile devices may lose data or initiate additional security measures once discharged or shut down.
3. Some components and devices are susceptible to immediate physical destruction and should be physically secured.
4. A device may be protected with a password, PIN, token or other authentication mechanism, the suspect may be queried for this information during the initial stage.
5. Document the location and condition of all handheld digital devices including on-screen data.
6. If possible, physically remove the battery from the device, otherwise power off the device in the appropriate manner.
7. Search the scene for removable media, passwords, or other pertinent information.
8. Use RF shielding, anti-static bags (e.g. Faraday bag, etc.)

**Evaluation (Triage):**
In order to access the contents of a memory device to assess its relevance to the case, it is essential to use blockers either by software - provided and validated by laboratories - or by blockers by firmware. In case of optical discs, you can proceed with your exam using a CD / DVD reader that does not allow writing.

**Procedure:**

1. Physically secure the mobile device. Separating the device from its user, network isolation are necessary to ensure evidence is not modified or destroyed.
2. Perform other forensic examinations (biological testing, fingerprints, DNA, etc.).
3. Block the mobile device from receiving RF signals by placing the phone in Airplane mode or using an RF shielding device. The “airplane mode” feature in newer versions of mobile operating systems may not disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other wireless protocols or may only disconnect them temporarily, manually confirm network isolation.
4. Turn off the mobile device if unable to block the RF signals.
5. Submit the mobile device for examination as quickly as possible.
6. Remove the battery from the mobile device, if possible, if storing it for an extended time. This will prevent the battery from corroding the inside of the mobile device.

**iOS Preservation Process:**

- iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple exclusively for its mobile hardware, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.
- All iPhones utilize hardware and software encryption so if the device has a password/passcode/Face ID then the user of the handset must supply the information required to gain access to the handset otherwise the forensic lab may not be able to access the handset data.
- Place the device in “Airplane Mode” (by swiping up from the bottom and selecting airplane mode) and verify that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are off. If the device cannot be placed in “Airplane Mode”, put it in a Faraday bag to prevent network interaction from potentially altering data on the device.
- Both the mobile device and the charging source should be placed inside the Faraday bag.
- If the charging source is not placed in the Faraday bag, the cable can act as an antenna and the device may be able to connect to the network. If the device is off, leave it off. Collect identifying data about the device, such as model number, carrier and unique identifiers that are visible.

**Android Preservation Process:**
Android is a Linux-based mobile operating system developed by Google and has the largest install base of any mobile operating system. Android is available in many different versions and, unlike iOS, is offered on devices manufactured by numerous companies.

**a) The device is power on.**

- Photograph the screen in the state it is in. Check the battery and if the date and time the device shows correspond to the actual date and time upon seizure.
- IMEI check: dial \* # 06 # and photograph. - Make a logical image of the device with the forensic device, including reading the SIM.
- Make a physical image of the device if it is supported.
- Turn off the device. Remove battery, SIM / USIM card and memory expansion card and photograph the assembly with the identification tag.
- Do not turn on the equipment again.

**b) The device is power off.**

- Check if support is available for acquiring a forensic image. - The battery is removed and the items to be checked are located: SIM card and external memory.
- If the device cannot be placed in “Airplane Mode”, follow the same procedure as for Apple devices. If the device is off, leave it off. Collect identifying data about the device, such as model number, carrier and unique identifiers that are visible.

**SIM / USIM:**
SIM card is read by checking if it is protected by a PIN. If available, it is entered only once, because if it is tried 3 times without success, it is blocked. To unlock it, you will need the PUK code, which is located on the original cardholder or that can be requested from the mobile service provider. In any case, the ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) will be obtained, which is its serial number.

**Removable Media/memory cards:**
If a handset allows the use of a removable memory card, then this card is used for expansion of the phone storage capacity. Removable storage is commonplace amongst Android handsets as this allows the user to store multimedia.

### 4. Servers:

- Server-type computer equipment provides service to other client computers. We can find them mainly in business environments performing functions of a file server, mail, web services, database, user management, etc.
- The preferred process to seize information from servers is to make a selective logical copy of the suspect's folder. But you also have to consider getting the event logs, the active directory settings, mailboxes and the backups.

### 5. Cloud Data:

- Both Apple and Android phones require the user to have either a Google Account (Android) or an iCloud account (Apple). These cloud services enable the user to backup data to the cloud, as well as share their photos, videos, audio files etc. They also make it possible to backup handset user data in case the device is lost or it has to be transferred to a new handset. The process of seizing cloud data, to be employed along with user credentials, Collect and document this information, subject to applicable legal requirements.

### 6. IoT devices:

In addition to the traditional IT devices described above, in recent years several devices have been defined as "IoT" or the Internet of Things. These devices can be very different from each other in terms of functionality, such as smart watches, smart TVs, video surveillance devices, and so on.

### 7. Smart-watches:

- A smartwatch contains several functionalities, allowing you to do many things you normally do with your phone. To seize a smartwatch, it would be preferable to follow the same indications already provided in the mobile phone section.
- The seizure of other IOT devices smart Tv, gaming console smart speakers etc., disconnect them collect user accounts and application passwords, document everything, take pictures of the device, label and pack.

### 8. Drones:

- Drones - also referred as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned aerial system (UAS), small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) or remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS).
- Digital forensics on drones and associated equipment is to identify flight paths, user data, and associated pictures and videos contained within the devices that will assist in understanding the drone and its usage. A drone usually consists of the following two types of components.
- Drones/controllers are usually presented with two distinct media storage types that require separate handling techniques.

**- If power on:**
Take pictures of the controller’s display then turn off the drone and its components. Isolate the drone from GPS satellites and other devices to ensure that GPS/Wi-Fi/Network signals contained. Identify the make and model of the drone. Search the drone for any external storage media, i.e. SD Cards. Photograph and label the status of the drone and its components. Securely pack all of the components.

**- Memory Cards:**
These can be examined as a computer hard disk. If time and resources allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and that clone inserted into the handset.

**- Internal Memory:**
This requires drone/mobile compatible manufacturer/forensic tools. Some devices are supported by forensic tools for physical extraction. The forensic tools will boot the device in a particular way and conduct physical extraction without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device.

### 9. Cryptocurrency/Virtual assets devices:

- First responders need to be aware of the different ways to access, store and transfer virtual assets. Crypto currency wallets come in different shapes and forms: files in a computer/phone, hardware devices, QR codes or even a sequence of words written in a piece of paper or memorized by the suspect.
- Desktop wallets: Bitcoin Core, Armory, Electrum, Wasabi, Bither, etc.
- Mobile wallets: Mycelium, Edge, BRD, Trust, etc.
- Online wallets: BitGo, BTC.com, Coin.Space, Blockchain.com, etc.
- Hardware wallets: BitBox, Coldcard, KeepKey, Ledger, Trezor, etc.
- Paper wallets: addresses generated by bitaddress.org, segwitaddress.org, etc. need to be searched.
- Regardless of the wallet type, the crucial information that needs to be collected is the unencrypted Private Key, In most cases, however, the Private Key is protected, or it might not be stored locally.
- Passwords, PINs, Credentials (username and password for online wallets), QR codes (can store the full private key), Seeds- the sequence of words (typically 24 or more) used to recreate the private key. For the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, private keys are 256-bit numbers that can be represented in many different ways. Wallet Import Format (WIF) is the most common.

**HASH function:**

- The HASH function or summary function is used to verify the integrity of a data set. In other words, it is about obtaining its “fingerprint”.
- In the case of electronic evidence, this procedure is applied when making copies of the original devices, so that, once the HASH value of the origin and destination has been calculated, they must be identical. This process is known as verification.
- It will remains same of same data but any slightest change in data will change the hashing value entirely which can be easily noticed on comparison.

**Different hashing algorithms are as follows:**

- MD5 (Message Digest 5)
- SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
- SHA-2 family (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA- 512)
- SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)

**Following tools are available for hashing:**

- Hash Check
- Hash Cal
- Hash Tab
- Hash My Files
- MD5 Hash Generator
- SHA-256 Online

### Imaging and Preview

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this procedure is to describe the steps for previewing and imaging computers and digital media on-scene.

**Scope:**
This procedure shall be followed when previewing and imaging computers and digital media on-scene.

**Equipment:**

1. Forensic computer
2. Windows preview/imaging software (FTK Imager, EnCase, etc.)
3. Hardware write blocker for various hard drive interfaces (EIDE, SATA, SCSI, etc.)
4. Wiped and formatted “destination” hard drive if imaging using evidence files (.E01 files)
5. Wiped “destination” hard drive if imaging using a RAW data dump (forensic clone of drive)

**Procedures:**

**Windows preview:**

1. Remove the hard drive from the subject computer.
2. Attach the subject hard drive to the appropriate hardware write blocker.
3. Attach the write blocker to the forensic computer.
4. Boot the forensic computer and run the Windows preview/imaging software.
5. Preview the computer’s hard drive for evidence related to the case.
6. Document the findings of the preview.

**Windows imaging:**

1. Remove the hard drive from the subject computer.
2. Attach the subject hard drive to the appropriate hardware write blocker.
3. Attach the write blocker to the forensic computer.
4. Boot the forensic computer and run the Windows preview/imaging software.
5. Image the computer’s hard drive to the destination drive.
6. Verify and document the integrity of the image file(s) by comparing the acquisition and verification hash values.

**Limitations:**

1. Failure to control the boot order of the computer may result in unintentional writes to the computer’s hard drive.
2. Laptop drives may require special hard drive interface adapters.
3. Hard drive removal from a computer may not be easily accomplished.
4. Previewing data on hard drives should be used for triage and not as an alternative to a full forensic examination.
5. The quantity of data and the time to process digital media can be limiting factors.

## **SOP ON ARREST BY PRIVATE PERSON**

### I. SOP FOR ARREST BY PRIVATE PERSON

Arrest of a person is a procedure where the liberty of a person is curtailed to apprehend him for the commission of a crime. This may also be done in case of suspicion, so that ,the alleged offender could be presented in court. It is important to arrest lawbreakers to ensure peace, law and order in the society.

### IV. VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE OF ARREST BY PRIVATE PERSON.

Under BNSS 2023, private persons have a specific set of guidelines that they must follow when arresting and producing an individual before a police officer. It is critical for private persons to adhere to these statutory provisions. However, even if there is non-compliance with these statutory provisions, this does not automatically subject the private person to penal action.
The actions of a private person must be examined in conjunction with the general exceptions outlined in sections 14, 17 to 19 of the BNS. Penal liability arises only if a private person commits or omits violations voluntarily, dishonestly, fraudulently, and intentionally, thereby, committing acts such as omission to give information to police bound by law, omits to assist police officer bound by law, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, criminal force, assault, abduction, intimidation, or voluntarily causing hurt etc..,

#### Detaining more than 6 hours by Private Person

In particular, detaining an individual for more than six hours, does not automatically result in penal action against a private person. It is the responsibility of the police officer to determine whether the delay in producing the arrested individual was due to any culpability. If culpability is found, the police officer can then take appropriate action in accordance with the provisions of BNS 2023.

#### Computation of time of 6 Hours and 24 hours

The BNSS 2023 framework ensures that the rights of individuals are protected through strict time limits on detention without oversight. It delineates clear responsibilities between private individuals and police officers regarding arrest and custody, ensuring that procedural safeguards are maintained while accommodating practicalities of private arrests. The BNSS 2023 also provides a detailed framework for the procedure of arrest and post-arrest protocols under Chapter V. This includes the seizure of property, informing the arrestee and their family of the grounds of arrest, conducting medical examinations, and other procedures necessary for investigating a cognizable offence. Section 58 of BNSS, which mandates that, no person shall be detained in custody for more than 24 hours without being produced before a magistrate, excluding the time required for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s court. By excluding the time, a person is held by a private individual from the 24-hour detention limit, the statute balances the need for immediate action in arrests made by private persons with the procedural rigor expected of law enforcement.

**Section 58**: This section imposes a duty on police officers to ensure that an arrested person is not detained for more than 24 hours without being presented before a magistrate. The 24-hour period begins when the police officer takes custody of the arrested person.

**Exemption for Private Persons (Section 40)**: The provisions regarding the arrest procedure and the 24-hour detention limit do not apply to private persons who make an arrest. Instead, private individuals are allowed up to 6 hours to hand over the arrested person to a police officer. The rationale behind this provision is to facilitate the production of the arrested individual before a police officer, who will then take custody and assume responsibility for the subsequent legal procedures.

**Calculation of Detention Time**: For police officers, the 24-hour detention period stipulated in Section-58 starts when they take custody of the person from a private individual. The time during which, the individual is detained by the private person is not counted within the 24-hour period.

**Duty of Police Officers**: Police officers must be diligent in ensuring that, once, they take custody of an arrestee from a private person, they adhere strictly to the 24 - hour rule to avoid unlawful detention.

**Conclusion**
Hence, statutory obligation under section 58 is only to the police officer as such, 24 hours stipulated under section 58 shall begin from the moment when police officer takes custody of arrested person from private person. Therefore, time of detention time by private person can be excluded from 24 hours as provided under section 58 of BNSS.

But, total period of detention in Judicial custody is 90 days in case of an offence punishable to death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment more than 10 years, in other offences the detention period is 60 days for granting mandatory bail. The Investigating officer may take police custody at a time or in different spells, not exceeding 15 days in total.

As per section 187 of BNSS, if an accused is arrested and there is no time to produce before the concerned jurisdictional Magistrate within twenty-four hours, he shall be produced before the nearest Judicial Magistrate and the Magistrate shall accept the remand and if necessary, shall also give police custody not exceeding fifteen days in total as per procedure in Section187 of BNSS. But, in case of special Acts like POCSO and SC/ST (POA)Act, only the designated special courts have the power to give police custody on production of the accused and on filing of requisition by the Investigation officer.

## **SOP ON PRESUMPTIONS ON ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE (COLLECTION, ADMISSIBILITY, PROOF & PRESUMPTIONS CHAIN OF CUSTODY)**

The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023 (BSA 2023) addresses technological advancements that the previous law did not cover. BSA provides for the admissibility of electronic or digital records as evidence with the same legal effect, validity, and enforceability as any other documents. To be admissible in court, electronic evidence must meet the tests of relevancy, admissibility, and proof as outlined in the BSA.

There are two types of evidence to prove a fact: oral and documentary.

- Oral evidence must be direct according to Section 55 of BSA, subject to certain exceptions.
- Documentary evidence must be by producing the original documents, with some exemptions as provided in BSA.
  The method of proving documents is specifically mentioned in BSA.

Electronic evidence is recognized as documentary evidence under the definition in Section 2(e) of BSA, but there is no specific method of proving electronic evidence.
Section 62 provides a special provision relating to electronic evidence, stating that it may be proved in accordance with the provisions of Section 63 of BSA. If the conditions of Section 63 are satisfied, electronic evidence shall be admissible in any proceeding without further proof or production of the original.

Section 63 of BSA deals with the admissibility of electronic records:

The conditions mentioned in sub-section (1) for the computer output are as follows:
(a) The computer output was produced by a computer or communication device that was regularly used to create, store, or process information for regular activities by the person in control of the device.
(b) During this time, information similar to what is in the electronic record was regularly entered into the computer or communication device as part of these regular activities.
(c) The computer or communication device was working properly throughout relevant time, or if it wasn't, any issues didn't affect the electronic record or its accuracy.
(d) The information in the electronic record comes from information that was regularly entered into the computer or communication device during these activities.

3. If over a period, the function of creating, storing, or processing information for regular activities was done using one or more computers or communication devices, whether:
   (a) in standalone mode,
   (b) on a computer system,
   (c) on a computer network,
   (d) using a computer resource for creating, processing, or storing information, or
   (e) through an intermediary,
   all these computers or devices will be considered as one single computer or communication device for this section. References to a computer or communication device in this section will be understood in this way.

4. In any legal proceeding where a statement from an electronic record is to be used as evidence under this section, a certificate must be submitted with the electronic record each time it is presented. The certificate must:
   (a) Identify the electronic record containing the statement and explain how it was produced.
   (b) Provide details about any device involved in producing the electronic record to show it was made by a computer or communication device mentioned in section (3).
   (c) Address any conditions mentioned in section (2).
   The certificate should be signed by the person in charge of the computer or device, or the person managing the relevant activities, and an expert. This certificate will serve as evidence of the matters stated within it. It is enough for the person to state these matters to the best of their knowledge and belief, as specified in the Schedule.

5. For this section:
   (a) Information is considered to be supplied to a computer or communication device if it is provided in any suitable form, either directly or through appropriate equipment, with or without human help.
   (b) Computer output is considered to be produced by a computer or communication device whether it was created directly by it or through appropriate equipment or other electronic means mentioned in section (3)(a) to (e), with or without human help.

**PROOF OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE**: The BSA specifies the mode of proving electronic records as follows:
Proof of Electronic Signature: If an electronic record contains a secure electronic signature, it can only be proved by the subscriber of that electronic signature (Section 66).
Verification of Digital Signature: To ascertain whether a digital signature belongs to a person, the court may examine the controller, certifying authority, or the person who applied the public key (Section 73).

**Presumptions on electronic records**: On proving of electronic evidence as above, the court has the power to presume the genuineness of electronic records.

- **Section 81** – The court shall presume that electronic or digital records claiming to be the Official Gazette or those required by law to be kept are genuine if they are kept in the correct form and produced from proper custody.
- **Section 85** - The court shall presume that every electronic record purporting to be an agreement containing the electronic or digital signatures of the parties was concluded by affixing those signatures.
- **Section 86** - The court shall presume, unless proven otherwise, that a secure electronic record has not been altered since the specific point in time to which its secure status relates. It also presumes, unless proven otherwise, that a secure electronic signature was affixed by the subscriber with the intention of signing or approving the electronic record.
- **Section 87** - The court shall presume, unless proven otherwise, that the information listed in an Electronic Signature Certificate is correct, except for subscriber information that has not been verified, if the certificate was accepted by the subscriber.
- **Section 90** - The court may presume that an electronic message forwarded by the originator through an electronic mail server to the addressee corresponds with the message as fed into his computer for transmission, but does not make any presumption about the person who sent the message.
- **Section 93** - The court may presume that any electronic record purporting or proven to be five years old and produced from proper custody was affixed with the electronic signature of the person it purports to be, or by any person authorized by him, subject to the Explanation to Section 84.
  The above provisions ensure that electronic evidence is handled consistently and fairly in legal proceedings under the BSA.

## **SOP - ROLE OF PHOTOGRAPHER U/S 497 BNSS, 2023**

The Apex court in _Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai_ vs _State Of Gujarat_ while dealing with disposal of property under Section 451 and 457 or Cr.P.C, certain guidelines were formulated, in which taking photographs while delivering the property for interim custody was mandated. This is the root cause for incorporating sub-section (2) to (5) of section 497 of BNSS, 2023 – detailing the procedure to be adopted by a Magistrate before passing an order for disposal of property. The procedure is as follows -

- Once the property is seized by Police during investigation, it may be produced before the Criminal Court, or the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance or to commit the case for trial.
- The Magistrate before whom the property is produced shall within in a period of 14 days of its production before him, prepare a statement of such property with its description in such form and manner as provided by the State Government. (State Government has to frame Rules in this regard)
- Later, the Magistrate shall cause to be taken the photographs of such property.
- Apart from photographs, the Magistrate if he thinks necessary, may take video-graph on mobile phone or any electronic media of such property.
- The above-mentioned statement and photograph or videography shall be used as evidence in inquiry or trail.
- Such statement, photograph or videograph has utmost significance as they alone can be used in evidence without the need for its physical production again during trial.
- However, no procedure for taking such photographs and videography is mentioned in this section.
- Hence, the Rules that are to be prepared under sub-section (2) of section 497, shall also include the procedure, for taking such photographs and videographs.
- This procedure shall include details like
  o who shall take the photograph or videograph
  o in which electronic devices the same shall be taken
  o how those photographs or videographs shall be submitted and made part of the court record
  o chain of custody of the photographs and videograph
  o who shall bear the expenditure for such photography or videography
  o how those photographs or videographs shall be certified to be genuine.
- Only after following the above-mentioned procedure i.e preparing statement, taking photographs or videograph, the Magistrate shall order for disposal of property under sub-section (5) of section 497, BNSS, 2023.

> **Note:** Where police seize property during an investigation, they should report the same to a Magistrate. If the seized property is not produced before the Magistrate but is in the custody of that police officer, the Magistrate has to dispose of the property in terms of Section 503 of BNSS, 2023. However, this section does not provide for taking photographs or videographs as contemplated under Section 497, BNSS, 2023. Hence, to give evidentiary value to such seizure, it shall be mandated that the procedure mentioned under subsections (2) to (5) of Section 497 be followed. Therefore, the State Govt. may have to frame rules in this regard.

## **SOP CHANGE IN JURISDICTION JJB'S**

**Q) Section 27 of Cr.PC was deleted so what is the impact on jurisdiction of juvenile cases?**

**Section 27 of Cr.PC Says: - Jurisdiction in the case of juveniles**.— _Any offence not punishable with death or imprisonment for life, committed by any person who at the date when he appears or is brought before the Court is under the age of sixteen years, may be tried by the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate, or by any Court specially empowered under the Children Act, 1960 (60 of 1960), or any other law for the time being in force providing for the treatment, training and rehabilitation of youthful offenders._

- Here we should consider age of a juvenile.
- In S.27 CrPC age is prescribed 16 years but now this was deleted in BNSS which means we should consider the age of a juvenile or child who is not completed age of 18 years as defined in S.2(13) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

**A) Removal of Section 27 of CrPC in BNSS will not have any effect in the present scenario as JJ Act being special enactment prevail over BNSS.**

- 'CHILD" is defined under Sec 2 (12) of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.
- A Person who has not completed 18 years of age is a child and the same definition is assigned for child in sec 2(3) of BNS, 2023.
- Sec 27 of CrPC says:
  a) Any offence not Punishable with death/life imprisonment.
  b) Any person who at the date when he appears or is brought before JJB is under 16 years of age.
  c) May be tried by chief Judicial Magistrate (or) Court specially empowered under Children Act 1960 or any other law.
- Under BNSS, this sec 27 CrPC has been removed entirely but this will not impact the current scenario since the provision regarding the same Section 27 CrPC has to be incorporated in JJ Act 2015.
- Sec 20 (20) of JJ act, children Court “ is defined in JJ Act:
  a) Court established under the commission for protection of Child Rights Act 2005.
  b) Court established under special Court under POCSO act 2012.
  c) Whenever, any Courts, not existing or designated, the Court of Session will have Jurisdiction to try offences under this Act.
- Section 4 JJ Act 2015:
  a) Notwithstanding anything contained in CrPC.
  b) State Government shall constitute JJB in every District.
  c) A board shall consist of metropolitan Magistrate or CJM along with 02 members.
  d) Bench has powers conferred by CrPC on Metropolitan Magistrate or JFCM.
- Section 86 (4) JJ Act:
  a) Notwithstanding anything contained in CrPC, or protection of child Rights Act 2005, or POCSO Act or offences under this Act shall be triable by Childrens Court.

**SYNOPSIS:**

- Definition of Child under JJ Act and BNS are one and the same.
- JJ Act defines the constitution of children’s Court JJ Act also discusses the power of MM/JFCM who is chairman of the board.
- S.86 (4) clearly states that, offences under JJ Act i.e., Offences committed by children **“ punishable under any penal act”** shall be triable by children Court/Board established under JJ Act.
- Section 2 (20) JJ Act defines Children Court.
- S.2(35) defines "juvenile" means a child below the age of eighteen years;
- Removal of Section 27 of CrPC in BNSS will not have any effect in the present scenario as JJ Act being special enactment prevails over BNSS.
- So all cases relating to Juvenile shall be dealt with as per the procedure of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

## **TREATMENT OF CASES WHERE CC NUMBERS ARE RELEASED AFTER GO-LIVE DATE FROM JUDICIARY BUT WERE REGISTERED EARLIER**

As per clause (a) sub-section (2) of Section 531 of BNSS, 2023, _any appeal, application, trial, inquiry_ **_or investigation pending_** _, then, such appeal, application, trial, inquiry or_ **_investigation shall be disposed of_** _, continued, held or made, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973... as if this Sanhita has not come into force._

This means that all the proceedings of case at whatever stage it may be i.e. from registration of FIR to final disposal of the case, if initiated under Cr.P.C. 1973 before BNSS, 2023 came into force. Then such proceedings at whatever stage it may be continued and disposed off as per the provisions of Cr.P.C 1973 only.

Therefore, it is opined that if a case is registered under IPC, 1860, however the CC number is given after BNSS, 2023 comes into force (1st July 2024) the case shall be tried as per the provisions of Cr.P.C 1973.
