## Background

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in W.P. (C) No. 565/2012 titled Nipun Saxena Vs. Union of India opined that "it would be appropriate if NALSA sets up a Committee of about 4 or 5 persons who can prepare Model Rules for Victim Compensation for sexual offences and acid attacks taking into account the submissions made by the learned Amicus. The learned Amicus as well as the learned Solicitor General have offered to assist the Committee as and when required. The Chairperson or the nominee of the Chairperson of the National Commission for Women should be associated with the Committee."

In view of the above, NALSA set up a committee consisting of the following members for preparation of Model Scheme:

- Ms. Pinky Anand - Additional Solicitor General
- Shri Rakesh Srivastava - Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India
- Shri T.V.S. N. Prasad - Additional Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India
- Ms. Indira Jaising - Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India
- Shri Alok Agarwal - Member Secretary, NALSA
- Shri Surinder S. Rathi - Director, NALSA
- Ms. Anju Rathi Rana - Joint Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, Govt. of India
- Shri K.L. Sharma - Joint Secretary, National Commission for Women
- Ms. Bharti Ali - Co-Director, HAQ: Centre for Child Rights

The Committee held rounds of meetings and it was decided to prepare a separate "Chapter" or a "Sub-Scheme" within the existing Victim Compensation Scheme for victims of sexual assault.

The Committee drafted Part – II of the Victims Compensation Scheme and invited suggestions/comments from various stakeholders on the draft. Taking into consideration the suggestions/comments, the Committee has finalized the Compensation Scheme for women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes and submitted the same before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 24.04.2018.

Submissions were made before the Hon'ble Bench and other stakeholders were also heard on 10.05.2018. Additional suggestions received during the hearing were also incorporated and final Scheme was filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 11.05.2018. On this day, after hearing NALSA and Ld. Amicus Curiae, Hon'ble Bench was pleased to accept this Scheme and directed all the State Governments/UT Administrations to implement the same in their respective States/UTs.

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India further observed that while nothing should be taken away from this Scheme, but it does not preclude the State Governments/UT Administrations from adding to the Scheme.
